### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is **Ozan ORKUN** :octocat:

I graduated from Electrical Engineering :mortar_board: but I am interested in web :computer: and mobile :iphone: software development, living in **Istanbul, Turkey**.

I am writing on [**Medium**](https://ozanorkun.medium.com/) and my [**Blog Site**](http://ozanorkun.com/). I love being part of development of web, mobile and IoT technologies.

I love **open source world** and I build things on my GitHub profile.

I love **JavaScript** and **Python**.
